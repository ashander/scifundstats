A quick and dirty analysis of #scifund contributors to success

percentage funded: 

* funding goal negative 
* more contribs better 
* having multiple contribs didnâ€™t help achieve full funding 
* longer description did not help, may slightly hurt 
* higher average contribution did not help

average contribution 

* having multiple contribs per contributor may up the average
contribution, but nothing else seems to help 
* may be driven by a few outliers (see Figure 2)
